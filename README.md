# Fredbot - St John's Compsci's HipChat Bot

Just a really simple, XMPP chatbot which connects to our HipChat server.
Doesn't do much at the moment, but theres room for expansion!

## Requirements

This project uses smack.jar and smackx.jar from the Smack XMPP client library provided by [Ignite Realtime][http://www.igniterealtime.org/downloads/index.jsp]. The jar files will need to be included in the classpath when compiling the software.

Apart from that, everything should be good to go!
